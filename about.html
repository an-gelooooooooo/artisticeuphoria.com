        Artistic Euphoria is an advocacy to promote the therapheutic tendencies of art to those who see art only as a creative form of expression. 
        We showcase different art from both local, and international, famous or not, and various art forms not limited to a canvas.
        The aim of this advocacy is to promote the therapheutic tendencies of art to individuals who sees art only as a creative form 
        of expression, to introduce people the emotions that art brings to artistic individuals, to enable a connection to the various art forms,
        and to convinve people that art is for everyone. To show that art does not discriminate. 
      </p>

       Artistic Euphoria's main purpose is to offer a therapheutic site with different kinds of art that will inspire everyone. 
       This project is worth sponsoring as it will provide a digitally euphoric space that gives people the inspiration to
       express themselves through art. This platform offers the user a safe place to show the beauty of art and be confident in sharing
       their deep understanding of life using art.
