        Abstract Art
      </h2>
      <p>
        abstract art, also called nonobjective art or nonrepresentational art, painting, sculpture, or graphic art in which the portrayal of things from the visible world plays little or no part. All art consists largely of elements that can be called abstract—elements of form, colour, line, tone, and texture. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to the 20th century these abstract elements were employed by artists to describe, illustrate, or reproduce the world of nature and of human civilization—and exposition dominated over expressive function.

        "Windows Open Simultaneously" by Robert Delauney
    </a>
</h3>
<p>
    “Windows open simultaneously” is a part of a twenty-two painting series called “Windows” by Robert Delauney.

When asked about this painting in 1913, Delaunay wrote, “Line is the limitation; the color gives depth, not perspectival, not successive but simultaneous depth—as well as form and depth.”

The line work used by Robert does a great job of hiding the Eiffel Tower right in front of the viewer while also giving the hint that the city in the frame is Paris.

The fractured pattern not only gives the abstract artwork its personality but also makes it one of the most famous cubist compositions.

It is now housed at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

        "Compositions" by Wassily Kandinsky
    </a>
</h3>
<p>
    Wassily Kandinsky was a famous abstract painter, known for comparing his abstract paintings to music, which is why he called them compositions.

    Emotions of anger and disgust are seldom portrayed when someone looks at this famous abstract painting for the first time.

        "1934 Relief" by Ben Nicholson
    </a>
</h3>
<p>
    Ben Nicholson’s primary goal was to portray space in a painting that demonstrates his avant-garde painting techniques.

Initially, the painting was just an irregular white on white painting.

Later in the year, Ben cut out the circles and the rectangles, which gave the artwork a collage-like feel.

The main motto of the painting was to signify the balance and depth that can be achieved in a painting.

        "Death and Fire" by Paul 
    </a>
</h3>
<p>
    The fact that Paul knew he was going to die soon and painted a death scene in the picture makes it one of the most disturbing abstract paintings.

The main subject of the painting, “Tod,” means death in German, and was often compared to the artist himself.

It’s said that Death himself is the figure running in the back right corner toward Tod.

A yellow glow covers the abstract artwork, which depicts the sunset and the end of life.

The final image of this abstract painting is a symbol of a funeral, where the ferryman takes you to the afterlife.

It is now located at Zentrum Paul Klee in Burn, Switzerland.

        "Full Fathom Five" by Jackson Pollock
    </a>
</h3>
<p>
    One of Jackson Pollock’s largest paintings, which is also similar to the painting “Autumn Rhythm”.

Jackson also employs the same methods as in that painting, laying the canvas flat on the ground and drizzling paint all over it.

The painting itself is a compilation of the colors tan, blue, and gray splattered all across the canvas.

When asked about this technique, Pollock said, “I am more at ease. I feel nearer, more a part of the painting since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides, and be in the painting. “
