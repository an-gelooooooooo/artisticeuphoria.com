        Digital Art
      </h2>
      <p>
        Digital art is the practice of creating and presenting art using technology. It is also known as computer art or multi-media art. It’s dependent on computer-based digital encoding and the electronic storage and processing of information in different formats; images, sounds.

Computers today have become more powerful and portable, allowing more access to the digital world, enabling the industry to grow to a whole new level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything we consume electronically today stands on the backbone of digital art. From the TV shows we watch, advertisements, software, applications, websites and billboards. The survival of all companies’ marketing is dependent on their use of visual art.

To get a deeper understanding, let’s have a look at how it all began.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The History of Digital Art
Who invented digital art? There are a few theories.
      </h2>
      <p>
        The first ever digital artwork piece dates back to 1952, created by Ben Laposky using an oscilloscope to manipulate electronic waves which appeared on a small fluorescent screen.

        The piece was known as Oscillon 40.
        
        One of the many unknown digital art facts is that the 1960s is said to be the era in which digital art came to existence, owing to John Whitney’s creation of the world’s first ever piece of art on a computer.

      <p>
        The term digital art was first used in 1980. This is the era when digital art became popular, thanks to the introduction of personal computers.

Computer engineers at the time came up with a paint program known as AARON, which was used by the pioneering digital artist, Harold Cohen, designed to make large drawings on paper sheets placed on the floor. This example of early computer art changed the industry forever.

        A solemn painting of two souls reunited but cannot be together. Promotes the idea of independence in life but dependent in love circle phenomenon. If one falls in love the attraction is on but unmagnifiable.

        A City of colours, crowded in ways yet reflection of lights are open to imagine a cinematic view of romance in the City.

A piece to reflect that there is romance even in the most of eventualities.

        A piece in respect of nature and natural life. The blended imagery of representation of labor in the middle of vast circumstance. Opens the idea of a drowning boat canoed by the ocean itself.

        Flames of eye, a justification art for those fighters who looks at unjustified things yet can do nothing, an ignored look towards something to fight for yet chose to stay quiet.

    Undiscovered Cities. A far representation of actions behind the veil, a backstage of illegal actions and trapped truths. A remote place free of rules and norms yet full of taboo. A Pandora place that each people create to bury things.
