        Food Art
      </h2>
      <p>
        Food art is the act of preparing, cooking and presenting food in creative ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        It incorporates everything from elaborate plating that we see in fine dining establishments to both simple and intricate fruit and vegetable carvings that are meant to be decorative in nature.

It is hard to say exactly when food art, vegetable carving, food sculpting, and other artistic ways forms of vegetable art first started.  The history of vegetable carving is disputed but many people believe it to have begun in Thailand 700 years ago. 
Others believe that vegetable carving originated in the time of the Early Chinese Dynasties, notably the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-906) and the Sung Dynasty (AD 960-1279).
      </p>
      <h2>
        What is Food Art?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Fruits and vegetables can be used to create items that are meant for a decorative purpose. You will often find examples of food carving at weddings, parties and receptions.

An interesting thing about these food carvings is that they are edible. Some food carvings are quite simple and can be easily done at home.

Others are quite elaborate and require a lot of skill and practice.

      </p>
      <p>
        Fruit and vegetable carving is a very common practice, even today, in European and Asian countries, notably Thailand. It involves the art of carving into the skin of the item to reveal the fleshy center, where the color is different.

This allows for all sorts of interesting and artistic creations. Vegetable carving is called Mukimono in Japanese. To read more, <a href="https://thegardeningcook.com/food-art/"><i>click here...</i></a>

    One culinary artist, going by the handle of mikyoui0, never had a job related to art or design, however, he has a son whom he wanted to teach food preparation and also instill a love for it. He decided to think out of the box and turn the learning process into a fun activity by making edible art. During the summer of last year, he started working with fish, therefore, it was a perfect opportunity to start the learning process! The artist taught his son how to slice and prepare sashimi and the whole learning process became a fun activity where he was able to make unique designs and form excellent works of art. The fun part is that by teaching his child, he ended up really getting into this amazing art himself.

    A life-long food and art enthusiast, Lauren Purnell, creator of these "culinary canvases," explains how she got started: "I cooked Spaghetti Carbonara for a few of my friends and had spent quite a bit of time locating the ingredients, prepping and cooking the food, then plating a presenting the dish. Despite the time and effort put into making said dish, the meal disappeared pretty quickly, without a moment given to appreciate its appearance. After dinner, I kind of zoned out and started playing with the leftover bits of food on my plate, eventually deciding to manipulate them into the shape of a tree — the 'spaghetree'. It became my first 'food art'.
